----------Description----------------------------
This game was part of a submission for the Weekly Game Jam. I sadly do not remember which game it was but this is an updated and polished version. So there is texture and better animation as well as controls and more. 

This was created alongside a fellow Colleague, I will try and get his Itch.io so I can link it later. 

The Theme was Companionship. So we thought of a boy and a pet rat trying to get through some sewers. Even though this was done over Spring Break, time management was a bit of a struggle. However, we got a finished product.  


----------Download Instructions------------------
The original Game Jam Submission is available for download on the itch.io for those interested. I have since updated the game as I wanted to polish the game. 

Download the folder and launch the executable.
